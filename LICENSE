### Why the symbols?
* **`#`**: One hash makes a Large Heading (H1).
* **`##`**: Two hashes make a Medium Heading (H2).
* **`*`**: Creates a bullet point.
* **`` `text` ``**: Wrapping text in backticks makes it look like code.
* **`` ```php ``**: Triple backticks start a "code block" that highlights the syntax for that specific language.

### How to create it:
1.  Create a new file in your project root named `README.md`.
2.  Paste the text above into it.
3.  Save it.

When you eventually push this to GitHub, GitHub will read those symbols and turn them into a professional-looking webpage for your project.

**Would you like me to show you how to add "Badges" to your README (those little green/red icons that show if your tests are passing)?**
